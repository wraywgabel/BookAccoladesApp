X-Remove [a] and other letters for citations from wiki copying (from fiction pulitzer list mainly)
X-Separate author and title (author, title) from pulitzer fiction Author finalist rows
Add genres?

Ideas:
X-Add goodreads ratings? Both mine and public (for public also add number of reviews)
X-Add genres and year published from google books API
X-Add read toggle (if ive read it)?
Import TBR from goodreads? And have it list awards?

Fix:
X-Book club years are all 2025?
X-Make it so authors that have won nobel prizes get that accolade on titles with that author.
X-Add count for number of books read/rated to all books section
